# Most Effective Roles in the 2013 NBA Basketball Season

We employ clustering tactics to analyze the NBA players of the 2013 season. By separating the players into groups we found two different types of play styles. These play styles differ in their ability to make blocks, field goals, turnovers and their skill to get rebounds and assists. To further divide the groups we further divided the groups by the amount of playing time and were able to see the All Star players of the 2013 season. Finally we looked at two teams an analyzed what lead to their success and what was their weakness.

* efg. - Effective Field Goal Percentage; the formula is (FG + 0.5 * 3P) / FGA. This statistic adjusts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth one more point than a 2-point field goal.
